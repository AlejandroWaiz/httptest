# unitary-tests
First steps into testing world. First going in with http test of a basic endpoint.


First we have the http test of a basic endpoint whose primary function is to return the double of the given value.
So in this test we are proving the endpoint itself and also the router.

Seconde one is Math test, that is a simple project that evaluates the correct values for given operations.
